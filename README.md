# Student Housing and Roommate Finder Database

## Project Overview

The **Student Housing and Roommate Finder Database** is designed to address the housing challenges faced by college students in Kigali, Rwanda. With an increasing student population and limited affordable housing, students struggle to find suitable living arrangements that match their preferences for location, affordability, and compatibility with roommates. This platform provides a centralized, database-driven solution to streamline the housing search process, enabling students to find rooms, compare listings, and connect with potential roommates. At the same time, it helps landlords efficiently manage listings and reach their target tenants, fostering a transparent and accessible housing market for all.

## Problem Statement

Kigali’s growing college student population faces challenges in securing affordable and suitable housing. The lack of a centralized platform for housing listings leads to wasted time and missed opportunities for students and landlords alike. Students often struggle with identifying affordable options that match their preferences for location and roommate compatibility, while landlords have limited channels to reach student tenants effectively. This project aims to bridge the gap between students and landlords, creating a more efficient and accessible housing ecosystem.

## Objectives

- Provide an easy-to-use interface for students to find affordable rooms, compare options by location, and connect with potential roommates.
- Enable landlords to manage listings effectively and reach student tenants.
- Foster transparency and trust within the local housing market by improving communication and reducing inefficiencies.
